My attempts at Advent Of Code 2024, where ChatGPT randomly selects a language I need to use to complete the challenge :D

# ❄️ Days 🎄 <br>

Day 1: Lua <br>
Day 2: Python <br>
Day 3: Rust <br>
Day 4: C++ <br>
Day 5: GoLang <br>
Day 6: Ruby

# Disclaimer 🎅

These solutions are purely to pass the challenge. Optimization, runtime complexity, etc is not always taken into account, especially considering I don't always have time to plan out these solutions.
